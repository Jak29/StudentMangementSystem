# StudentMangementSystem

I developed an application that can store student records. The
records consisted of information about each student and information
about modules they have completed and the grades they received in
those modules. I used Java as the programming language, JavaFX to
create a GUI for the front-end and derby as the database to store the
information. We were also tasked with making use of the MVC
design pattern. I found this challenging but very satisfying and I really
enjoyed the process.


Technologies Used: 
Java, Junit, JavaFX, Derby
